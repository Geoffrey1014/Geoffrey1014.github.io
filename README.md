## Weigang He
He is a Research Assistant (Mentor: [Ting Su](https://tingsu.github.io/)) of East China Normal University (2022-). He is also a Visiting Scholar of Ant Group, Hanzhou, China (2022-). He got his M.S. in software engineering from East China Normal University ([ECNU](https://english.ecnu.edu.cn/)), Shanghai, China (2018-2021).

His research interests are in: 
- Mobile App Analysis and Testing (GUI Fuzzing) 
- Fuzzing Compilers/Program Analyzers

### Research Programs
#### Testing Static Analysis Tools. (Mar.2022 – Aug.2023)
Aims to design an effective fuzzing test scheme to automatically find false negatives, false positives and tool crash defects of the static analysis tools within Ant group and Alibaba.

#### [Aiding Diagnosing Automated GUI Testing Tools for Android.](https://github.com/the-themis-benchmarks/home/tree/industrial_tools_evaluation) (Jul.2021 – Aug.2022)
Design and implementation of a tool to automatically instrument benchmarking apps and measure the
testing effects of automated testing tool on the benchmark.

#### [Automated Test Case Generation for PLC Programs.](https://github.com/Geoffrey1014/ST_DSE) (Jul.2019 – Jun.2021)
Design and implementation of algorithms to generate high-coverage unit test cases of PLC program for control flow and data flow coverage criteria based on dynamic symbolic execution.

<!-- #### Translation from the Simulink Model to the NuSVM Model. (Feb.2020 – Oct.2020)
Implementation of a tool to automatically translate airborne Simulink models to the NuSVM models to verify specifications.

#### Formal Analysis and Verification of Airborne Software Based on DO-333. (Nov.2018 – May.2019)
Utilizing the Air Data Computer software as the research object and applying different formal methods to verify software life-cycle artifacts to illustrate the formal methods and tools available in the verification process of airborne software. -->
