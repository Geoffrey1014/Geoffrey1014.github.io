I am a first year Dual-degree PhD student in Software Engineering, advised by Prof. [ He Jiang ](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/jianghe/en/index.htm) in School of the Software in the [ Dalian University of Technology](http://en.dlut.edu.cn/), and in Computer Science, advised by Prof. [ Lingxiao Jiang ](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/lxjiang/) and Prof. [ Xuhua Ding ](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/xhding/) at the School of Information Systems in [ Singapore Management University ](https://www.smu.edu.sg/). 

My research interests are focusing on developing practical techniques and tools that can help improve the correctness, reliability, and security of the system software. I am particularly interested in developing automated approaches (i.e. fuzzing) for engineering tasks such as testing or debugging in system software (i.e. compiler and Linux kernel) using program analysis methods (i.e. symbolic execution).
