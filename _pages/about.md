Software systems written by humans tend to be unreliable and insecure. My research interests focus on developing practical techniques and tools that can help improve the reliability and security of software systems (mainly system software such as compilers and Linux kernel). I am quite interested in developing advanced automated approaches, based on program analysis techniques such as fuzzing and symbolic execution, to resolve labor-intensive engineering tasks, e.g., automatic bug finding and exploit generation. 


## Recent News

  * [Apr 2022] Our paper titled "*Detecting C++ Compiler Front-end Bugs via Grammar Mutation and Differential Testing*" was accepted by IEEE Transactions on Reliability! (Highlight: we have reported 136, of which 67+ have been confirmed or fixed by developers, bugs in GCC and LLVM compiler front-ends)
  * [Dec 2020] Our paper was rejected from ICSE 2021... Hmmm, keep smile and move on!
  * [Mar 2020] Opened my academic homepage!
